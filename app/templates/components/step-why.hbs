      <p>
        You need a purpose related to a function of your business for each piece of information you collect. Information you collect needs to be necessary for these purposes, and must support your business in a clearly defined way. If you don’t actually need the information, it’s better to not collect it.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are given information that you didn’t ask for (didn’t &ldquo;collect&rdquo;) these requirements don’t apply, however the provisions (covered later on) requiring safe storage, correction, and access by users still apply.
      </p>

      <p>
        Identify a clear purpose and sticking to it is the key to getting privacy right. See

If there's a reasonable chance information can be used to identify a living person, it's considered "Personal Information" by New Zealand law (even if no names appear). The information doesn't need to be “secret” or “sensitive” – it just needs to be about them.

Examples of personal information include

Identity information:

Name, username, email-address,  password, date-of-birth/Age, gender, etc

Location information:

GPS Location, physical addresses, etc

Behavioural information:

Interests, browsing habits, searches, contacts or associates, etc

Computer/Network information:

Browser identifiers/fingerprint, IP address, network information, etc

Financial information:

Credit card, purchase history, etc

… many any other things. The types of information that can identify someone can be very broad.

# Priv-o-matic 

Priv-o-matic is an interactive Javascript tool for creating the privacy statements required by New Zealand law for small to medium enterprises (SMEs).

The goal is to improve the overall quality of online privacy statements seen in New Zealand, by making it easy for small business owners less familiar with privacy law to create statements.

While this was made for the NZ Privacy Commissioner's website, the intention was that it would be possible for others to improve the tool or reused it elsewhere (possibly in another jurisdictions).

For more info on NZs privacy law requirements see the [Privacy Commissioner's Office website][1].
